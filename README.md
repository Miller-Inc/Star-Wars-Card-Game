# Star Wars Card Game
## About
This is the digital version of a game my brother came up with that is based on other Star Wars games that we haved played but modified to fit what we would want for a game to play together. 

## Game Basis
There are three main modes if the game. The first is to play against players on your local network in a turn based strategy game to battle to the death. The second mode is can allow for upgrades for your characters on your roster and is made in a story-like fashion to upgrade each character along their journey. The third mode is a scenario designed by the player to play agaist the computer. 

### Multiplayer 
This mode is hosted on a single device acting as a server which other devices connect to in order to play the game. 

### Storyline Mode
This mode is played on your device and upgrades your characters that can be used in other modes. 

### Simulation Mode
This mode is where the player can setup their roster and their opponents' rosters and scale the difficulty of the computer(s).
